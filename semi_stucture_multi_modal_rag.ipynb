       "[\"CASA Account\\n1. What is a current account?\\nAns. A Current Account is designed for businesses to manage daily transactions\\nlike cheque issuance, deposits, fund transfers, withdrawals, etc. Every individual\\nwho wants to start a business must open a Current Account with a bank.\\n2. What is a savings account?\\nAns. Savings Account is the most basic Bank Account type that you can open\\nwith any bank or financial institution. A Savings Account lets you park your idle\\nmoney, thus keeping it safe. Depositing funds is the best option rather than hiding\\nthem in your home’s locker, where the chances of theft are more. Whenever you\\nopen a Savings Account, the banks generally give you a Debit Card that offers\\neasy access to money through ATM withdrawal, plus you can also get your hands\\non offers by top brands.\\n3. What is the benefit of creating a current account?\\nAns. 5 benefits of a Current Account:\\n1. Business Transactions: A current account is specifically designed\\nfor businesses and allows you to conduct various financial\\ntransactions required for your business operations, such as paying\\nsuppliers, receiving payments from customers, and managing daily\\nexpenses.\\n2. Unlimited Transactions: Unlike savings accounts, current accounts\\nusually come with no or high transaction limits, allowing you to carry\\nout numerous transactions without incurring extra charges.\\n3. Overdraft Facility: Many current accounts offer an overdraft facility,\\nwhich allows you to withdraw more money than the balance in your\\naccount, up to a pre-approved limit. This can help you manage\\ntemporary cash flow challenges.\\n4. Business Banking Services: Current accounts often provide\\nadditional business banking services, such as the issuance of\\nbusiness cheques, online banking platforms tailored for businesses,\\nand merchant services to accept card payments.\\n5. Business Growth: A current account provides a separate platform for\\nmanaging your business finances, enabling you to track your\\nbusiness's income and expenses separately from your personal\\nfinances. This separation is crucial for monitoring business growth and\\nensuring accurate financial reporting.\\n4. What is the benefit of creating a savings account?\\nAns. 5 benefits of a Savings Account:\\n1. Safe Storage of Funds: A savings account provides a secure place\\nto keep your money, protected by the bank and often insured, offering\\npeace of mind.\\n2. Liquidity: Savings accounts allow easy access to your funds through\\nvarious channels like ATMs, cheques, and online banking, ensuring\\nliquidity and convenience.\",\n",
       " \"3. Interest Earnings: While the interest rates may not be high, savings\\naccounts provide a modest return on your deposits, contributing to\\nyour savings growth over time.\\n4. Emergency Fund: Savings accounts are an ideal platform for building\\nan emergency fund, providing a safety net during unexpected\\nsituations.\\n5. Financial Discipline: Maintaining a savings account encourages\\nresponsible money management, helping you set aside a portion of\\nyour income for saving.\\n5.

       " \"Ref: Investopedia\\n16. What is a CASA account?\\nAns. A Current Account Savings Account (CASA), provided by Kori bank, merges\\nthe features of a current account and a savings account. Customers earn minimal or\\nno interest on the funds in the current account, which are used regularly for paying\\nbills, but they receive interest on the savings portion.\\n17. What is the benefit of creating a CASA account?\\nAns. Creating a CASA account offers several benefits:\\n1. Encourages Regular Saving: CASA accounts are designed to make saving\\neasier and more flexible, encouraging regular deposits.\\n2. Better Liquidity: Customers can access their money anytime without having it\\ntied up for months, trading off a higher interest rate for better liquidity.\\n3. Convenient Transactions: Combining features of current and savings accounts,\\nCASA accounts allow for frequent transactions and easy bill payments.\\n4. Builds Bank Relationship: Consumers and small businesses can develop a\\nstrong working relationship with their bank over time, which can be beneficial for\\nfuture financial needs.\\n5. Easy Access: With a CASA account, customers can manage their daily banking\\nneeds conveniently, whether online, through ATMs, or in branches.\\n6. Interest Earnings: Even though the interest rates are lower compared to fixed\\ndeposits, customers still earn some interest on the savings portion.\\n7. Overdraft Facility: Many CASA accounts offer overdraft facilities, providing a\\nfinancial cushion when needed.\\n8. Safety and Security: Funds in CASA accounts are generally insured by the bank,\\noffering a secure place to store money.\\nIn summary, CASA accounts offer a flexible, accessible, and convenient way to\\nmanage money while still earning some interest and building a strong banking\\nrelationship.\\n18. What's the Difference Between a CASA Account and a Savings Account?\\nAns: Interest Earnings: A portion of a CASA account functions as a savings\\naccount, where the customer earns interest on their deposit. However, the interest\\nrate is typically slightly lower than that of a regular savings account.\\nIntegrated Savings and Checking: By integrating checking and savings features\\ninto a single account, CASA accounts are designed to facilitate regular saving for the\\ncustomer on a weekly basis.\",\n",
       " [\"Accessibility and Usage: While a regular savings account also promotes saving,\\ncustomers are more likely to leave those funds untouched. In contrast, CASA savings\\nare more accessible.\\nStability for Lending: This accessibility means that banks cannot rely on CASA\\ndeposits remaining stable week to week, making them less stable for the bank's\\nlending purposes, and therefore, they offer lower interest rates.\\n19. What's the Difference Between a CASA Account and a Current Account?\\nAns.\\n20.Do CASA Accounts Offer Competitive Interest Rates?\\nAns. A CASA account generally offers a lower interest rate compared to other\\naccounts at Kori. The key difference lies in the time commitment.\\nA CASA account has no time commitment, allowing the customer to access their\\nmoney anytime.\\nTo obtain a higher interest rate, you must commit to keeping your money in the bank\\nfor a specific period. The longer the commitment, the higher the interest rate.\\n21. How is CASA account different from Current account and Savings account?\\nAns.

 The image displays a graph showing a line of data with a blue line on the left side and an orange line on the right side. The blue line is labeled "CMB (Cosmic Microwave Background) filtered," while the orange line is labeled "CMB (Cosmic Microwave Background) unfiltered." The graph appears to be a representation of the Cosmic Microwave Background, which is a faint, uniform glow of radiation that fills the universe.

The graph is accompanied by a text description, which reads, "CMB filtered and unfiltered data." The image also includes a number, "10," which could be related to the data being displayed or the units of measurement.
